/**
 * Per-resource hook that returns a `Decision` for every relevant capability.
 * Each hook calls `useCurrentMember()` once and threads the context into the
 * pure rules in `rules.ts`.
 *
 * `wsId` is explicit (not read from `WorkspaceIdProvider`) so the hook stays
 * usable outside a workspace context — matches the repo rule for
 * workspace-aware hooks.
 *
 * Resource = `null` collapses every Decision to a denied "unknown" — keeps
 * callers branch-free during loading. The same collapse happens while the
 * member list is still on its *initial* fetch (`isLoading` from React Query
 * is `isPending && isFetching`, so background refetches never flip it):
 * without it, a not-yet-loaded role reads as `null` and an admin who isn't
 * the resource owner gets a hard deny flashed at them during load. Callers
 * that need to distinguish "denied" from "still resolving" read `isLoading`.
 *
 * `canArchive` / `canRestore` / `canManage` are deliberately not exposed:
 * the backend gates them identically to `canEdit`, so callers can use
 * `canEdit` everywhere and read better at the call site.
